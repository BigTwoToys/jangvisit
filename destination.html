                    <h5>Paseo Del Mar</h5>
                    <p class="text-0">Paseo Del Mar is located very close to the historical landmark and National Museum known as Fort Pilar. Paseo Del Mar is also known for its several restaurants, cafés and entertainment as well. With an eight arch entrance where there is 24 hour security, it is one of the most popular areas to visit among locals and tourists. The Paseo Del Mar is similar to the Manila bay walk and the evening it is lit up by a beautiful sunset as well. This is an ideal place with a great view and good food, where you can leisurely walk along the promenade. At night time the Paseo Del Mar is lit up with decorated lamps and there is much livelier atmosphere with a Dancing Fountain, food stalls and live entertainment as well. With the Santa Cruz Island Ferry nearby you can even see both Santa Cruz Islands from the shore which makes a beautiful ocean scene. </p>
